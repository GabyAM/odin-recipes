    <h3>A burger is a popular fast-food dish made from a seasoned ground meat patty, typically beef, served inside a sliced bun and often garnished with various toppings like lettuce, tomato, cheese, and condiments.</h3>
    <p>A burger, short for "hamburger," is a quintessential American comfort food that has gained worldwide popularity. It consists of a savory and well-seasoned patty, traditionally crafted from ground beef, but variations can include other meats like turkey, chicken, or even vegetarian options like black bean or mushroom patties. The patty is cooked to perfection, usually on a grill, griddle, or stovetop, giving it a delicious crust while maintaining a juicy interior.</p>
